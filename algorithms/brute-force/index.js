// BUBBLE SORT
// Given an array, bubbleSort will sort the values in the array. The function takes 2 parameters: an array and an optional comparator function.
// Bubble sort is an O(n^2) 

// SELECTION SORT
// Tepeatedly scans the list for the smallest (or largest) element, places it in its correct position, and continues with the remaining unsorted elements.

// LINEAR SORT
// In an unsorted array, this method looks at each element one by one until it finds the target value. It doesnâ€™t attempt to skip elements or make assumptions; it just checks each item in sequence.

// String Matching (Naive Pattern Search): This algorithm searches for a substring by moving across every possible starting point in the main string and checking if the substring matches.
