// A frequency counter is a technique typically used to count occurrences of unique elements within a dataset. It involves keeping track of how often each element appears, often using a hash map or array where keys represent unique elements and values represent counts. Frequency counters are particularly useful in situations like counting word frequencies in text or tracking occurrences of numbers.
