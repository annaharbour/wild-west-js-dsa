//  Like a tree, a trie has a hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes. Each node represents part of the data (typically a single character in a string), and paths down the tree represent sequences (e.g., prefixes or complete words).

// Tries are often called *prefix trees* because they group common prefixes together. Each level in a trie typically represents one character position in a string, so similar strings branch off from common prefixes, conserving memory.

// No Fixed Child Count: Similar to general trees, nodes in a trie can have any number of children. For example, a node representing "a" might have children nodes for "b," "c," and so on, depending on the words being stored.

// Tries have a specialized purpose for efficiently storing and searching strings based on their prefixes. This makes them particularly useful for tasks like autocomplete and spell checking.
